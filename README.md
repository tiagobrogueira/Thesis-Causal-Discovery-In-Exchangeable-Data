This repository contains:

The exchangeabledatasetcreation.ipynb which is a python notebook containing all the functions required to generate the synthetic dataset present in the PIC report: "Causal Discovery in Exchangeable Data". It also loads the Tubingen dataset.

The folder "allfigs", contains all the figures produced. The folder "Tuebingen" contains the plots from the CE Tubingen dataset. The folder "generate_scenarios" has the same figures as "allfigs" but separated according to the chosen priors and function.
